## Features
- Includes a `CoinCollection.cs` script, demonstrating coin collection and UI updates using TextMeshPro.
- Contains a `movement.cs` script, showcasing basic player movement with camera control and jumping.
- Offers a simple `README.md` for context.
- Provides a small set of files, ideal for experimenting with LLM code analysis.

## Installation
No specific installation is required to view the code. This repository is structured to be easily browsed, read, and understood. There are no installation steps as the files are not meant to be run directly.

## Usage
You can use this repository by directly referencing its contents when prompting an LLM. For example, you could ask an LLM questions such as:

- "What does the `CollectCoin` method in `Collection.cs` do?"
- "Explain the movement logic in `movement.cs`."
- "How does `Collection.cs` use TextMeshPro?"
- "What are the variables defined in `movement.cs` and their purpose?"

You can also filter the output of this repository by using a query parameter. The API is linked in the top header.

## Dependencies
- **Unity Engine:** This is the primary environment for which these scripts are written, but it is not a dependency for using this repo as context with an LLM.
- **TextMeshPro:**  A Unity package used for the UI elements in `Collection.cs`.
